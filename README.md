# What I learned 
What I learned from this challenge was a lot actually, I feel like I am really getting to the point of being able to read the code really well, it taught me how to create a databse and then pull the information back from the database to be used in sorting information. I approached this differently at first as well so it also taught me that there are many ways to approach coding these challenges. Using mySQL for the first time was challenging but rewarding as well.  

# Credits 
This app can be credited to Jack Killeen with some help from the TAs and one tutoring session, we decided to change gears last second and pretty much rewite the code so one of the TAs helped a lot and lent me their github repo for reference
